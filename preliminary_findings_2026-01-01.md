# Preliminary Findings: City Livability & Climate Research
**Date:** January 1, 2026
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete - Data Collection & Initial Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

This research project identified and analyzed **50+ mid-size cities** (population 50,000-1,000,000) across five continents to find optimal relocation candidates based on climate quality, livability factors, and forward-thinking urban policies. Using Boulder, Colorado as our baseline, we've compiled comprehensive data and preliminary rankings.

### Key Finding
**Cities offering both mountains AND ocean proximity with 250+ sunny days are rare but exceptional.** The California Central Coast (San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara), Chilean coast (La Serena), and Spanish Mediterranean (Valencia, Malaga) emerged as top performers combining all criteria.

## Regional Highlights

### North America (Best Overall Region for Criteria)

**Top Performers:**
1. San Luis Obispo, CA - Perfect Mediterranean climate, mountains + ocean
2. Santa Barbara, CA - Slightly higher humidity but exceptional beauty
3. Victoria, BC - Best outside USA, mildest Canadian climate
4. Boulder, CO - Baseline excellence, no ocean access

**Climate Patterns:**
- US Southwest (NM, AZ) offers 280-310 sunny days but no ocean
- California Central Coast uniquely provides mountains + ocean + sun
- Colorado Front Range cities have excellent sun (240+) but cold winters

**Challenges:**
- California coastal cities have high cost of living (Index 125-145)
- Boulder housing extremely expensive (239% of national average)
- Limited public transit compared to Europe

### Europe (Best for Walkability & Sustainability)

**Top Performers:**

2. Malaga, Spain - 320 sunny days (Europe's sunniest), mountains + beach
3. Nice, France - Alps meet Mediterranean, cooler summers
4. Graz, Austria - Best overall livability score, no ocean

**Climate Patterns:**
- Spanish Mediterranean coast: 300-320 sunny days, 60-70% humidity
- Southern France: 300 days sun, slightly lower humidity than Spain
- Portugal: More affordable but Atlantic climate (higher humidity, fewer sunny days)

**Standout Finding:**
European cities dominate sustainability metrics with net-zero targets by 2030-2040, extensive bike infrastructure (40-60% modal share in Netherlands), and excellent public transit.

### Oceania (Best for Safety & Nature Access)

**Top Performers:**
1. Hobart, Tasmania - Exceptional safety, Mt. Wellington access, mild summers
2. Nelson, NZ - NZ's sunniest city (245 days), mountains + coast

- Queensland coastal: 240-270 sunny days, warm year-round, higher humidity
- Tasmania: 200 sunny days, coolest summers (22°C), dramatic scenery
- New Zealand: 175-245 sunny days depending on region, higher humidity

**Trade-offs:**
- Geographic isolation from Northern Hemisphere
- Smaller cities = fewer amenities
- Australia has higher cost of living than many alternatives

### South & Central America (Best Value)

**Top Performers:**
1. La Serena, Chile - 280 sunny days, ocean + Andes, great value
2. Mendoza, Argentina - 300 sunny days, wine country, very affordable

**Climate Patterns:**
- Chilean coast: Mediterranean climate, 240-280 sunny days
- Ecuadorian highlands: Constant 65°F, 180-200 sunny days
- Colombian highlands (Medellín): 72°F year-round, "eternal spring"

**Unique Opportunity:**
Exceptional affordability (cost of living 35-50% of US) combined with pleasant climates, though infrastructure and safety scores lag behind developed nations.

## Data Quality Notes

### High Confidence Data
- Climate metrics from NOAA, WMO, and national weather services (30-year normals)
- Population from official census data (2023-2024)
- Walk/Bike Scores from walkscore.com
- Cost of Living Index from Numbeo (2025 Q4)

### Medium Confidence Data
- Safety indices (mix of crime statistics and perception surveys)
- Sustainability scores (some self-reported by cities)
- Kid-friendly scores (composite of education rankings and recreation access)

### Data Gaps
- EV infrastructure data incomplete for South American cities
- Bike infrastructure scores estimated for many cities outside Europe
- Airport distance data approximate for some locations
- Some smaller cities lack detailed Walk Score data

### Known Limitations
1. "Sunny days" definitions vary by source (clear vs. partly cloudy thresholds)
2. Humidity measurements taken at different times/locations affect comparisons
3. Cost of living fluctuates with currency exchange rates
4. Climate change is shifting historical patterns (data may not reflect future)

## Key Insights

### 1. The "Sweet Spot" Cities

Cities that score highly across ALL dimensions are rare. Those offering 250+ sunny days, low humidity, mountains, ocean, good walkability, AND affordability essentially don't exist. Trade-offs are inevitable:

- **California coast:** Climate + geography, but expensive
- **Spanish coast:** Climate + geography + affordable, but not English-speaking
- **Chile/Argentina:** Climate + affordable, but less developed infrastructure
- **Boulder baseline:** Excellent everything except ocean access and affordability

### 2. Climate vs. Cost Trade-off

Clear inverse relationship between climate quality and cost:
- **Best climate cities** (CA coast, Nice) have COL Index 85-145
- **Best value cities** (Ecuador, Argentina, Portugal) have 200-280 sunny days
- **Middle ground:** Spanish coast offers 300+ sunny days at Index 45-50

### 3. Walkability Correlates with Sustainability

Cities ranking high on walkability (Walk Score 80+) almost always rank high on sustainability, bike infrastructure, and public transit. European cities dominate this correlation:
- Utrecht, Groningen (Netherlands): Walk 88-90, Bike 95-96
- Graz, Salzburg (Austria): Walk 83-84, Transit 85-89
- Freiburg, Regensburg (Germany): Walk 80-82, Bike 87-92

### 4. Southern Hemisphere Underrepresentation

Relatively few cities in Australia/NZ and South America meet all criteria:
- Australia: Only 8 cities in 50k-1M range with 200+ sunny days
- New Zealand: Only 6 cities, most below 200 sunny days
- South America: Infrastructure scores pull down otherwise excellent climate cities
